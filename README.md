I was able to implement dynamic lighting during this week's iteration. This was a pretty big learning curve for me, I had to extensively read up on the three.js dynamic lighting protocol in order to implement this. I had to do a good amount of refactoring and re-working the flow of my application. Next week, I plan to implement the transformations and style up my house.
